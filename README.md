# Moesif Envoy WASM Plugin

The Moesif Envoy WebAssembly plugin captures API traffic from [Envoy Service Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) and logs it to [Moesif API Analytics](https://www.moesif.com). This plugin leverages an asynchronous design and doesnâ€™t add any latency to your API calls.

- Envoy is an L7 proxy and communication bus.
- Moesif is an API analytics and monetization platform.

## How to Install

### 1. Download the Plugin

The `moesif_envoy_wasm_plugin.wasm` file can be downloaded directly from the GitHub releases page. To do so:

1. Navigate to the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/Moesif/moesif-envoy-wasm-plugin/releases).
2. Find the latest release and download the `moesif_envoy_wasm_plugin.wasm` file from the assets section.

### 2. Load the Plugin into your Envoy Proxy

1. Transfer the downloaded `moesif_envoy_wasm_plugin.wasm` file to the Envoy proxy server.
2. Place the wasm file in an appropriate directory (for example, `/etc/envoy/proxy-wasm-plugins/`).
3. Ensure the Envoy proxy has read access to the wasm file.

### 3. Configure Envoy

Update your Envoy configuration (`envoy.yaml`) to use the Moesif Envoy plugin. Add the `http_filters` and `clusters` sections as shown in the provided code snippets.

Remember to replace `<YOUR APPLICATION ID HERE>` with your actual Moesif Application Id. Your Moesif Application Id can be found in the [_Moesif Portal_](https://www.moesif.com/). After signing up for a Moesif account, your Moesif Application Id will be displayed during the onboarding steps.

The `upstream` config defaults to 'moesif_api' and is optional, but if you use something else in the clusters.name field, you will need to explicitly include the `upstream` config value to match.

Also, remember to update the filename path in the `vm_config` section to match the location where you placed the `moesif_envoy_wasm_plugin.wasm` file.

```yaml
http_filters:
# ... other filters ...
- name: envoy.filters.http.wasm
  typed_config:
    "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.http.wasm.v3.Wasm
    config:
      name: "moesif_api"
      root_id: "moesif_api_root_id"
      configuration:
        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.StringValue"
        value: |
          {
            "moesif_application_id":"<YOUR APPLICATION ID HERE>", 
            "user_id_header":"X-User-Example-Header",
            "company_id_header":"X-Company-Example-Header",
            "upstream": "moesif_api"
          }
      vm_config:
        vm_id: "moesif_api_vm"
        code:
          local:
            filename: "/etc/envoy/proxy-wasm-plugins/moesif_envoy_wasm_plugin.wasm"
# ... other filters ending with router
- name: envoy.filters.http.router
  typed_config:
    "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.http.router.v3.Router
clusters:
# ... other clusters ...
- name: moesif_api
  type: strict_dns
  load_assignment:
    cluster_name: moesif_api
    endpoints:
    - lb_endpoints:
      - endpoint:
          address:
            socket_address:
              address: api.moesif.net
              port_value: 443
  transport_socket:
    name: envoy.transport_sockets.tls
    typed_config:
      "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.UpstreamTlsContext"
```

### 4. Restart Envoy

After saving the updated configuration file, restart Envoy to apply the changes. Check Envoy's log to ensure that there are no errors during startup.

### 5. Test

Make a few API calls that pass through the Envoy proxy. These calls should now be logged to your Moesif account.

## How to Use

###  Capturing API traffic
The Moesif Envoy plugin captures API traffic from Envoy and logs it to Moesif automatically when Envoy routes traffic through the plugin.  Envoy has detailed and robust configuration options for traffic and plugin routing to apply the Moesif plugin to only some traffic or to all traffic. For more information, please refer to the [Envoy Request Lifecycle Guide](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/life_of_a_request#configuration).

###  Identifying users and companies

This plugin will automatically identify API users so you can associate API traffic to web traffic and create cross-platform funnel reports of your customer journey. The plugin currently supports reading request headers to identify users and companies automatically from events.

- If the `user_id_header` or `company_id_header` configuration option is set, the named request header will be read from each request and it's value will be included in the Moesif event model as the `user_id` or `company_id` field respectively.
2. You can associate API users to companies for tracking account-level usage. This can be done either with the company header above or through the Moesif [update user API](https://www.moesif.com/docs/api#update-a-user) to set a `company_id` for a user. Moesif will associate the API calls automatically.

## Configuration Options

These configuration options are specified as JSON in the `configuration` section of the `http_filters` in your `envoy.yaml` file.

| `batch_max_wait`       | Integer | 2                       | Optional. The maximum wait time in seconds before a batch is sent to Moesif, regardless of the batch size.                              |
| `upstream`             | String  | "moesif_api"            | Optional. The upstream cluster in Envoy that points to Moesif's API.                                                                            |

### Example

```yaml
configuration:
  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.StringValue"
  value: |
    {
      "moesif_application_id":"<YOUR APPLICATION ID HERE>", 
      "user_id_header":"X-User-Example-Header",
      "company_id_header":"X-Company-Example-Header",
      "batch_max_size": 100,
      "batch_max_wait": 5,
      "upstream": "example_custom_envoy_cluster_naming_scheme_moesif"
    }
```

### Updating the Configuration

Updating the envoy.yaml configuration file in the example above and restarting is sufficient to update your Moesif WASM Plugin configuration. Envoy has a diversity of configuration mechanisms and supports hot reloading of configuration. For more information, please refer to the [Envoy Configuration Documentation](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/operations/dynamic_configuration).

## Examples

### Envoy Docker Compose

If you're using Docker, you can use the provided `docker-compose.yaml` to easily set up your environment. The Docker Compose file includes three services:

- `rust-builder`: This service builds the wasm binary from the Rust source code.
- `envoy`: This service runs the Envoy proxy with the Moesif Envoy plugin.
- `echo`: This is a simple echo server for testing purposes.

### Steps

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.
2. Clone the project repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Moesif/moesif-envoy-wasm-plugin.git
    cd moesif-envoy-plugin/examples/envoy
    ```

3. Build and start the services using Docker Compose.

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

4. Now, you can send requests to `http://localhost:10000`. The Envoy proxy listens on this port, forwards the requests to the echo server, and logs the requests and responses to Moesif.

5. You can view the Envoy logs with the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose logs envoy
    ```

Remember to replace `<YOUR APPLICATION ID HERE>` in `envoy.yaml` file with your actual Moesif Application Id. Your Moesif Application Id can be found in the [_Moesif Portal_](https://www.moesif.com/).
